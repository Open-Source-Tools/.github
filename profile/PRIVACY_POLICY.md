Information We Collect
We collect information you provide to us when you make a donation to our open source project. This may include your name, email address, and payment information such as credit card or PayPal account information. We do not store or have access to your credit card or PayPal account information.

Use of Information
We use the information we collect to process and acknowledge your donation, to communicate with you about your donation, to send you updates about our open source project, and to provide you with receipts and other important information related to your donation.

We may also use your email address to send you newsletters, marketing communications, and other information about our open source project, but only if you have given us your consent to do so.

Sharing of Information
We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. We may share your information with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as processing payments, sending emails, and providing technical support. These service providers are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality of your information and are prohibited from using your information for any other purpose.

We may also disclose your information if required by law or if we believe that such disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

Security of Information
We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. However, no data transmission over the internet or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.
